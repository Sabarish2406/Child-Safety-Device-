# Child-Safety-Device-
A safety device capable of monitoring and providing live location of children ensuring safety for parents. 
A smart wearable Internet of Things prototype was developed for monitoring the environment of a child ensuring safety. A GPS module was used as a mechanism for tracking the child. An advantage of the device was its simplicity making it useful over any phone not requiring a lot of technical knowledge from the user. The device also featured a GSM module that overcame the vulnerability of needing to be connected to the WIFI or Bluetooth. The purpose of wass to help parents easily locate their child and ensure its safety. The basic mechanism of this system involves monitoring the environment by the sensor nodes in real-time and transmitting the data to a cloud server. The data can be displayed to users through a web-based interface located on the cloud server and the device will alert the user via a mobile application when an emergency condition is detected. The design of this model involves having a medium for communication between the child's wearable device and the parent/guardian.
